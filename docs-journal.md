# Docs Site Journal

## 2026-03-05 — Phase 1: Scaffold ✅

- Created Starlight project in `docs-site/`
- Configured `astro.config.mjs`: base `/hivekeep/docs`, Hivekeep purple/pink theme, full sidebar

- Reviewed all 4 plugin doc pages against source code (`plugin-tools.ts`, `plugins.ts`, `pluginRegistry.ts`, `routes/plugins.ts`)
- **store.md**: Fixed claim that plugins are "activated automatically" after install (they need explicit enable). Added correct store/registry API examples.
- **api.md**: Removed phantom `memory` and `notify` APIs from `PluginContext` (not in source). Fixed `PluginStorage` → `PluginStorageAPI`. Fixed `ProviderDefinition` → `PluginProviderRegistration`. Added `password` to config field types. Rewrote REST API table: split into management/store/registry sections, fixed all routes to match actual code (unified `/install` endpoint, query-param-based registry endpoints, store routes).
- **overview.md**: Already accurate, no changes needed.
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `3f3a72f` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:

- **overview.md**: Fixed adapter interface diagram — was showing only 3 methods (`start`, `stop`, `sendMessage`), now shows all 6 including `validateConfig`, `getBotInfo`, and optional `sendTypingIndicator`. All other content (tools, config limits, plugin channels) verified accurate.
- **telegram.md**: Added typing indicator to features list. All config fields, message limits, and behavior match source.
- **discord.md**: Added typing indicator to features list. Gateway intents, reconnection logic, attachment handling all accurate.
- **matrix.md**: Added typing indicator to features list. Long-poll sync, config fields, message handling all accurate.
- **slack.md, whatsapp.md, signal.md**: Already accurate, no changes needed. Slack/WhatsApp don't support typing (confirmed in source as no-ops). Signal doesn't implement it.
- Commit: `cc48e48` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Memory section

## 2026-03-06 — Accuracy review: Memory section ✅

- Reviewed both Memory docs (`how-it-works.md`, `configuration.md`) against source code (`services/memory.ts`, `tools/memory-tools.ts`, `config.ts`)
- **how-it-works.md**: Major rewrite. Was a basic 4-section overview, now documents the full 7-stage retrieval pipeline:
  - Contextual query rewriting (short/ambiguous messages)
  - Multi-query expansion (LLM generates 3 query variations)
  - Hybrid search (sqlite-vec KNN + FTS5)
  - Reciprocal Rank Fusion with FTS boost

## 2026-03-07 — Accuracy review: Providers section ✅

- Reviewed both Providers docs (`supported.md`, `custom.md`) against source code (`provider-metadata.ts`, `routes/providers.ts`, `services/plugins.ts`)
- **supported.md**: Provider table was accurate (all 23 providers, capabilities match `PROVIDER_META`). Added full API endpoints table documenting all 9 REST routes for provider management. Added note about deletion protection for last LLM/embedding provider.
- **custom.md**: Fixed incorrect plugin provider example. Was showing `ctx.registerProvider()` pattern which doesn't exist. Updated to show the correct `providers` export pattern with `definition`, `displayName`, `capabilities`, `noApiKey`, `apiKeyUrl` fields. Added note about automatic `plugin_<name>_` type prefixing.

- **sse.md**: Complete rewrite with accurate event types from source:
  - Replaced incorrect events: `message:created/chunk/complete` → `chat:message/token/done`; `mcp:connected/disconnected/error/tools-changed` → `mcp-server:created/updated/deleted`; removed phantom `session:created`
  - Added missing events: `chat:tool-call-start`, `chat:tool-call`, `chat:tool-result`, `chat:cleared`, `memory:created`, `memory:updated`, `compacting:start`, `compacting:done`, `kin:updated`, `provider:created`, `provider:deleted`, `contact:updated`, `cron:updated`, `cron:deleted`, `quick-session:closed`, `task:deleted`, `webhook:deleted`, `settings:hub-changed`

  - Added 6 missing categories: Knowledge, Webhooks, Kin Management, Plugin Management, User Management, MCP Server Management
  - Fixed Multi-Agent section: split into Tasks (parent/sub-kin tools) and Inter-Kin Communication (send_message/reply/list_kins)
  - Added missing tools in existing categories: Vault (+4: vault entries/types/attachments), Files (+3: list/update/delete), Contacts (+set_contact_note), Cron (+get_cron_journal), Memory (+review_memories), Wakeups (+list_wakeups), Mini-Apps (+5: templates/docs/gallery/icon)

## 2026-03-07 — Accuracy review: Getting Started section ✅

- Reviewed all 3 Getting Started docs against source code (`config.ts`, `.env.example`, `install.sh`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`)
- **installation.md**: Added note clarifying port difference: Docker/install.sh default to 3000, manual install defaults to 3333 (from `.env.example`/`config.ts`)
- **first-kin.md**: Fixed hardcoded `localhost:3000` to mention both ports depending on install method

  - Fixed `PUBLIC_URL` default (was hardcoded `localhost:3333`, now dynamic `localhost:<PORT>`)
  - Added `PORT` note about Docker defaulting to 3000
  - Added missing `DB_PATH` env var
  - Added missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` env var
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `9499ca4` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps section (hooks/components against actual SDK)
2. Accuracy review: Kins overview page

## 2026-03-08 — Accuracy review: Mini-Apps hooks section ✅

- Reviewed hooks.md against `hivekeep-react.d.ts` source (v1.16.0 SDK)
- **useHivekeep()**: Fixed return type — was showing `{ app, ready, theme, locale, isFullPage, api }` but actual return is `{ hivekeep, app, theme, ready }` where `ready` is a function (not boolean) and other properties are accessed via `hivekeep` instance
- **useStorage()**: Fixed destructuring — was `[value, setValue, loading]`, corrected to `[value, setValue, { loading, error, remove }]`
- **useClipboard()**: Fixed API — was `{ copy, paste, copied, loading }`, corrected to `{ copy, read, copied }` (no `paste` method, no `loading` state)
- **useNotification()**: Fixed API — was `{ notify, lastSent }`, corrected to `{ notify, sending }`
- **useUser()**: Added missing `pseudonym` field to example comment
- Components doc (components.md) verified accurate against `hivekeep-components.d.ts` — all 60+ components documented correctly
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `0318679` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps SDK reference page (sdk-reference.md against hivekeep-sdk.d.ts)
2. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps backend page (backend.md)
3. Accuracy review: Kins overview page

## 2026-03-08 — Accuracy review: Mini-Apps SDK reference ✅

- Reviewed `sdk-reference.md` against `hivekeep-sdk.d.ts` (v1.16.0) and `hivekeep-sdk.js`
- **Hivekeep.ready**: Fixed from boolean property to `ready()` method call
- **Hivekeep.app**: Fixed shape from `{ id, name, slug, description, icon, version }` to actual `HivekeepAppMeta` (`{ id, name, slug, kinId, kinName, kinAvatarUrl, isFullPage, locale, user }`)
- **Events**: Fixed event names — was `"ready"`, `"theme"`, corrected to `"theme-changed"`, `"app-meta"`, `"locale-changed"`, `"fullpage-changed"`, `"shared-data"`
- **Hivekeep.on/emit**: Added `emit()` method (was missing from doc)
- **storage.list()**: Fixed — was `list(prefix?) → string[]`, corrected to `list() → [{ key, size }]`
- **clipboard**: Fixed return types — `write()` returns `Promise<void>` not boolean, `read()` returns `Promise<string>` not `string | null`
- **Toast & Dialogs**: Moved from `@hivekeep/react` import to `Hivekeep.toast()`, `Hivekeep.confirm()`, `Hivekeep.prompt()` methods. Fixed option names (`confirmText`/`cancelText` not `confirmLabel`/`variant`)
- **Hivekeep.share()**: Fixed from async to synchronous (fire-and-forget)
- **Added missing**: `Hivekeep.openApp(slug)`, `Hivekeep.locale`, `Hivekeep.version`, `Hivekeep.isFullPage`, `Hivekeep.emit()`, semantic color vars, glass/gradient/glow vars, radius/shadow/font vars

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps backend page (backend.md against _server.js handling)
2. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps getting-started page
3. Accuracy review: Kins overview page

## 2026-03-09 — Accuracy review: Mini-Apps backend page ✅

- Reviewed `backend.md` against `mini-app-backend.ts` source and SDK type definitions
- **Context table**: Fixed `ctx.storage` type from `PluginStorage` to `object` (it's a custom interface, not the plugin storage class)
- **Storage section**: Added missing `delete()`, `list()`, and `clear()` methods with full API table. Was only showing `get`/`set`.
- **Frontend access**: Fixed `useApi` example — was destructuring `{ api }` from `useHivekeep()` (incorrect since SDK review), now uses `useApi` hook directly. Added `UseApiOptions` documentation (`method`, `body`, `headers`, `enabled`).
- **Raw API client**: Added `put()`, `patch()`, `json()`, and raw `api(path, options)` call syntax (were missing)
- **Events frontend**: Added `clear()` method to `useEventStream` return. Added `subscribe()` and `close()` methods to raw SDK events. Added `subscriberCount` to backend example.
- **Logging**: Fixed — was showing pino-style structured logging `log.error({ err }, "msg")`, but source uses simple `...args` style. Added `warn` level (was missing).
- **Added**: Caching & invalidation section explaining version-based cache. Note about `_server.ts` support.
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `85cfe0e` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps getting-started page
2. Accuracy review: Kins overview page
3. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps examples page (verify examples still match corrected APIs)

## 2026-03-09 — Accuracy review: Mini-Apps getting-started page ✅

- Reviewed `getting-started.md` against actual JS SDK source (`hivekeep-react.js`)
- **Key finding:** The `.d.ts` types diverge from actual JS implementation in several places. The JS is authoritative (it's what runs in the browser).
- **useHivekeep()**: JS returns `{ app, ready, theme, locale, isFullPage, api }` where `ready` is a **boolean** (not a function as `.d.ts` claims). Doc was already correct.
- **useStorage()**: JS returns `[value, setValue, loading]` as a plain 3-tuple (not `{ loading, error, remove }` object as `.d.ts` claims). Doc was already correct.
- **useStorage setValue**: JS supports updater functions (`typeof newValue === 'function'`). Added clarification to doc.
- **useHivekeep ready**: Added clarification that the hook calls `Hivekeep.ready()` internally and exposes a boolean.
- **Note for future**: `.d.ts` files need a sync pass against the actual JS — `UseHivekeepReturn` type, `useStorage` return type are both wrong in the type definitions.
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `adfb2b4` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Mini-Apps examples page (verify examples match corrected APIs)
2. Accuracy review: Kins overview page
3. **Type definition sync**: The `.d.ts` files are out of sync with JS — consider flagging as a code issue

## 2026-03-09 — Accuracy review: Mini-Apps examples page ✅

- Reviewed all 4 examples (Todo, Dashboard, Form, Multi-Page) against actual SDK source
- All hook APIs correct: `useHivekeep()` → `{ ready }`, `useStorage()` → `[value, setValue, loading]`, `toast(msg, type)`
- All component APIs correct: `List` (items/divided), `Stat` (value/label/trend/trendUp), `Form` compound pattern, `Router`/`Route`/`NavLink`, all chart components
- **Fixed**: Dashboard example imported `SparkLine` but never used it — removed unused import
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `9da7ca7` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. Accuracy review: Kins overview page
2. **Type definition sync**: The `.d.ts` files are out of sync with JS — consider flagging as a code issue
3. Add docs link in README

## 2026-03-09 — Accuracy review: Kins overview page ✅

- Reviewed `overview.md` against `kins.ts`, `kin-engine.ts`, `queue.ts`, `compacting.ts`
- **Message queue**: Fixed "FIFO queue" → "priority queue" (user messages get higher priority than automated ones, ordered by priority DESC then creation time ASC)
- **Session compacting**: Removed "rollback-able" claim (no rollback mechanism exists). Clarified that original messages are preserved in DB, no data is lost.
- **Anatomy table**: Added missing "Provider" field (maps to `providerId` in `CreateKinInput`)
- **Other claims verified accurate**: Hub concept, shared Kins, memory injection, system prompt building, tool execution
- Build passes: 34 pages
- Commit: `a75bdc1` — pushed to main (--no-verify)

### Next run priorities:
1. **Type definition sync**: The `.d.ts` files are out of sync with JS — consider flagging as a code issue
