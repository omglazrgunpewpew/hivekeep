title: Your First Kin
description: Create your first AI agent in Hivekeep.

A **Kin** is a persistent AI agent with its own identity, memory, and tools. Unlike disposable chat sessions, a Kin remembers every conversation and builds knowledge over time.

## Creating a Kin

1. Open Hivekeep in your browser (default: `http://localhost:3000`, or port `3333` for manual installs)
2. Complete the onboarding wizard (set up your admin account and first AI provider)
3. Click **New Kin** in the sidebar
4. Give it a **name**, **description**, and optionally a **system prompt**
5. Choose an AI **model** from your configured providers
6. Start chatting

## What makes a Kin?

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Display name (e.g. "Research Assistant") |
| **Description** | What this Kin does |
| **System prompt** | Instructions, personality, expertise domain |
| **Model** | Which AI model to use (can be changed anytime) |
| **Avatar** | Visual identity (auto-generated or custom) |

## Key concepts

### Persistent memory

Every conversation is automatically stored. Kins extract important facts into long-term memory and can recall them later using vector similarity + full-text search.

### Session compacting

When a conversation gets long, Hivekeep automatically summarizes older messages to stay within token limits. Original messages are always preserved — compacting is non-destructive and reversible.

### Tools

Kins come with 100+ built-in tools out of the box: web search, memory management, file handling, sub-agent delegation, cron jobs, and more. See [Tools](/hivekeep/docs/kins/tools/) for the full list.

### Collaboration

Kins can talk to each other, delegate tasks to sub-agents, and work on cron schedules. They're not isolated chatbots — they're a team.
