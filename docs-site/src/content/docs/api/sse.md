title: SSE Events
description: Real-time Server-Sent Events for live UI updates.
---

Hivekeep uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to push real-time updates to the web UI. Connect to the SSE endpoint to receive live notifications about changes.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/sse
```

Requires authentication. Returns a `text/event-stream` response.

## Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connected** — Server sends a `connected` event with a `connectionId`
2. **Ping** — Server sends `ping` events every 15 seconds to keep the connection alive
3. **Events** — Real-time events are delivered as `message` events with JSON data
4. **Disconnect** — Client closes the connection; server cleans up automatically

## Event Format

Each event is a JSON object with a `type` field and contextual fields:

```json
{
  "type": "event-type",
  "kinId": "optional-kin-id",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Client Usage

```javascript
const evtSource = new EventSource('/api/sse', {
  withCredentials: true
})

evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)

  switch (data.type) {
    case 'chat:token':
      // Append streaming token to UI
      appendToken(data.data.token)
      break
    case 'chat:done':
      // Finalize message display
      finalizeMessage()
