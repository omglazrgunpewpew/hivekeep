# Hivekeep QA Journal

## 2026-03-03 04:40 UTC
### Area tested: (none - blocked)
- **Issue:** Could not access the app. Sandbox browser is disabled (`agents.defaults.sandbox.browser.enabled` is false), host browser requires Chrome extension tab attachment, and `web_fetch` blocks private IPs.
- **Action needed:** Enable sandbox browser in OpenClaw config, or attach a Chrome tab before running QA.
- **Bugs found:** 0
- **UX suggestions:** 0

### Next run
- Area 1: Onboarding / First run (once browser access is resolved)

## 2026-03-03 16:40 UTC
### Area tested: Login / Authentication
- **Pages visited:** Login page (`/`), Invalid invite page (`/invite/test-invalid-token`), Non-existent page redirect
- **Browser:** Used `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium) - works!
- **Login method:** Used JS `evaluate` to set React input values (native `type` action doesn't trigger React state updates on this app)
- **Bugs found:** 2 (issues created: #22, #23)
  - **#22 (bug):** App crashes with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'charAt')` when a user has no `user_profiles` row. Root cause: `UserMenu.tsx` accesses `user.firstName.charAt(0)` without null check. Affects 4 files.
  - **#23 (bug/security):** The `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email` endpoint is open to anyone, allowing unauthenticated account creation even though the UI has no sign-up form. Combined with #22, this means anyone can create accounts that crash the app.
- **UX suggestions:** 1 (issue created: #24)
  - **#24 (enhancement):** Login page missing "Forgot password?" link, loading state on Sign In button, and Enter-to-submit confirmation.
- **All clear:**
  - Invalid credentials error message is clear and well-positioned
  - Show/hide password toggle works correctly (label updates too)
  - Empty form submission handled by HTML5 validation
  - Invalid invite tokens show proper error with "Go to login" button
  - Non-authenticated routes correctly redirect to login
  - Cloudflare Turnstile is integrated (visible in page source, though may not block headless browsers)

### Next run
- Area 2: Agent management (need to login as Nicolas or create a proper test user through onboarding)
- Note: To test authenticated pages, either need Nicolas's password or a way to create users through the onboarding flow

## 2026-03-04 00:40 UTC
### Area tested: Agent Management (Create, Edit, Delete)
- **Pages visited:** Main dashboard (`/`), New Agent dialog, Edit Agent dialog (General, Tools, Memory tabs), Delete confirmation dialog, Agent chat view (`/agent/test-qa-agent`)
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), logged in as existing user
- **Login:** Credentials from `e2e/helpers/auth.ts` (test@hivekeep.local)
- **Bugs found:** 1 (issue created: #30)
  - **#30 (bug):** Import button in "New Agent" dialog does nothing when clicked. No file picker, no UI change, no error. Either the feature is broken or unimplemented without any user feedback.
- **UX suggestions:** 2 (issues created: #29, #31)
  - **#29 (enhancement):** Model selector shows ALL models from providers including non-chat models (audio, realtime, transcribe, TTS, image-only). The list is enormous and overwhelming. Should filter to chat-compatible models only.
  - **#31 (enhancement):** Slug field is only available in Edit mode, not during Agent creation. Minor QoL improvement to allow setting it upfront.
- **All clear:**
  - Create flow works well: "Describe your Agent" dialog with Generate/Create manually/Import options
  - Generate button correctly disabled until text is entered
  - Manual creation form has proper required field validation (Name, Role, Model all required, Create button disabled until filled)
  - Avatar auto-generates initials from name (e.g. "TE" for "Test QA Agent")
  - Model selector has provider filter buttons (All, Claude, OpenAI) that work correctly
  - Token count updates in real-time for Character and Expertise sections
  - Default Character and Expertise templates are helpful
  - Edit dialog has all creation fields plus Slug, and full Tools/Memory tabs
  - Tools tab shows all native tool categories with toggle switches and count (e.g. "Search 1/1", "Web Browse 3/3")
  - Tool categories are expandable to show individual tools
  - Opt-in tools (Agent Management, System, Database) are correctly off by default
  - Memory tab in edit shows search, category filter, empty state, and "Add memory" button
  - Add memory form has Content, Category dropdown (default: Fact), Subject (optional)
  - Memory save button correctly disabled until content is filled
  - Delete flow has proper confirmation dialog ("Are you sure? This will permanently delete...")
  - Delete works correctly, Agent removed from sidebar immediately
  - Chat view loads properly when selecting an Agent, with conversation starters and rich text editor
  - Agent card ordering in sidebar can be changed (drag handles present)
  - Slug auto-generated from name correctly (e.g. "test-qa-agent")

### Next run
- Area 3: Conversations (send messages, check chat UI, scroll behavior, empty states)
- Or Area 4: Tasks/Crons (create, edit, enable/disable, delete tasks)

## 2026-03-04 04:40 UTC
### Area tested: Settings page (Area 9)
- **Pages visited:** Settings dialog (all 11 tabs: General, AI Providers, Search, MCP Servers, Vault, Memories, Files, Channels, Webhooks, Contacts, Users, Notifications)
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium)
- **Login:** Existing session from previous run
- **Bugs found:** 1 (issue created: #37)
  - **#37 (bug/i18n):** In Settings > Notifications, the last toggle shows raw i18n keys `notifications.types.mention` and `notifications.descriptions.mention` instead of translated text. All other notification types display correctly.
- **UX suggestions:** 0
- **All clear:**
  - Settings dialog opens correctly as a modal overlay
  - Left navigation has clear grouping (Core, Extensions, Connections, Access) with 11 tabs total
  - **General:** Global prompt textarea with live token counter, Save button disabled when no changes
  - **AI Providers:** Two providers (Anthropic Claude Max, OpenAI) displayed with capability badges (LLM, Embedding, Image). "Test all connections" button works perfectly - shows progress bar, "2 passed" result, and toast notification. "Add provider" form has 22+ provider types in dropdown with capability labels, proper required field validation (API key), "Show password" toggle, helpful links to get API keys
  - **Search:** Brave Search configured, default provider dropdown, add button
  - **MCP Servers:** Clean empty state with description and add button
  - **Vault:** Category filter tabs (All, Favorites, Secret, Credential, Card, Note, Identity), "Manage types" button, clean empty state
  - **Memories:** Model Configuration section (Extraction Model, Embedding Model dropdowns), "Re-embed all memories" button, search bar with category and Agent filters, 5 memories shown with rich metadata (category, subject, source Agent, auto/manual, score), edit/delete per memory, "Add memory" button
  - **Files:** Clean empty state with upload button
  - **Channels:** Clean empty state with descriptive text
  - **Webhooks:** Clean empty state
  - **Contacts:** Shows Nicolas VARROT with "Human" badge, email, edit/delete buttons, "Add note" and "Add contact" buttons
  - **Users:** Shows user profile (Nicolas VARROT, @MarlburroW, email, join date, language "fr"), Invitations section with "Invite" button
  - **Notifications:** 7 notification toggles with descriptions, all checked by default. Notification sound toggle. External delivery section with "Add delivery channel" button
  - Footer shows version (v0.9.0), uptime, and summary counts consistently across all tabs
  - "What is this?" expandable help section present on most tabs
  - Every empty state has clear description text and a call-to-action button
- **Note:** Agent pages (`/agent/dev`, `/agent/dispatcher`) consistently cause the headless browser to timeout/hang, likely due to WebSocket connections or heavy React rendering. This blocked testing Area 3 (Conversations). May be specific to headless Chromium rather than a real user-facing issue.

### Next run
- Area 4: Tasks/Crons (create, edit, enable/disable, delete tasks - can test from sidebar without entering an Agent page)
- Or Area 3: Conversations (if browser stability improves)

## 2026-03-04 08:40 UTC
### Area tested: Scheduled Jobs (Area 4 - partial) + Tasks sidebar
- **Pages visited:** Main dashboard (`/`), Create scheduled job dialog, Job detail dialog, Edit job dialog, Delete confirmation dialog
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target
- **Login:** qa@hivekeep.local (password reset via DB to bypass auth)
- **Bugs found:** 0
- **UX suggestions:** 3 (issues created: #38, #39, #40)
  - **#38 (enhancement):** Schedule field shows no validation feedback for invalid cron expressions. The human-readable description disappears silently, no error message or red border.
  - **#39 (enhancement):** Task instructions are not required to create a scheduled job. A job with empty instructions can be created and will fire with nothing for the Agent to do.
  - **#40 (enhancement):** Schedule display ("At 09:00") shows no timezone information. Users don't know if this is UTC, server time, or their local timezone.
- **All clear:**
  - Scheduled Jobs section has clean empty state with description and CTA button
  - "New job" button opens a well-structured creation dialog
  - Cron preset buttons (Every 5 min, Hourly, Daily 9am, etc.) work correctly and fill the schedule field
  - Human-readable cron description ("At 09:00") appears correctly for valid expressions
  - "Minute Hour Day Month Weekday" helper text below schedule field is helpful
  - Owner Agent dropdown shows all Agents with avatars, names, and descriptions
  - Target Agent and Model fields are optional with good default messaging
  - Form validation enables Create button when Name + Owner Agent + Schedule are filled
  - Created jobs appear immediately in sidebar with name, schedule description, and next-run countdown
  - Toggle switch to enable/disable jobs works correctly - paused jobs lose countdown timer
  - Job detail dialog shows all info: name, owner Agent, status, schedule, instructions, model, execution history
  - Edit dialog pre-fills all fields correctly
  - Edit has "Delete job" and "Save changes" buttons
  - Delete has proper confirmation dialog with clear warning text
  - Unsaved changes dialog appears when closing form with modifications
  - Task search in sidebar works (filters tasks by name, shows "No tasks found" empty state)
  - Collapsible sidebar sections (Tasks, Scheduled Jobs, Mini-Apps) toggle correctly
  - Jobs search bar appears when jobs exist
- **Note:** Browser automation continues to be challenging with Hivekeep. The `type` action does not reliably fill React controlled inputs (Name field). CodeMirror editor (Task instructions) requires `document.execCommand` to properly update state. Agent pages still cause browser timeouts. Auth required resetting the QA user password via DB because the test@hivekeep.local user from E2E helpers doesn't exist in the live instance.

### Next run
- Area 3: Conversations (send messages, chat UI, scroll behavior) - requires navigating to an Agent page which causes browser hangs
- Area 11: Contacts (add, approve, edit, delete) - testable from Settings
- Area 12: Webhooks (create, edit, test, delete) - testable from Settings
- Area 5: Provider settings - testable from Settings

## 2026-03-04 12:40 UTC
### Area tested: Contacts (Area 11) + Webhooks (Area 12) + Channels (Area 6 - partial)
- **Pages visited:** Settings > Contacts, Settings > Webhooks, Settings > Channels
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target
- **Login:** Existing session

#### Contacts (Area 11)
- **Bugs found:** 0
- **UX suggestions:** 0
- **All clear:**
  - Contact list shows existing contacts with type badge (Human), name, and identifiers
  - "Add contact" form: Name (required), Type dropdown (Human, Agent), Link to system user (None, existing users), Identifiers section
  - Identifiers: "Add identifier" creates inline row with type combobox (email, phone, mobile, twitter, instagram, linkedin, github, slack, website + searchable) and value textbox
  - Button correctly disabled until Name is filled
  - Contact creation shows "Contact added" toast, appears immediately in list
  - Edit form pre-populates all fields correctly (name, type, identifiers)
  - "Link to system user" dropdown shows registered users with display name + username
  - "Add note" feature: inline note form with Agent selector, scope (Global/Private), and note textbox
  - Delete has proper confirmation dialog ("This will permanently delete this contact and all associated identifiers and notes")
  - Delete shows "Contact deleted" toast, contact removed immediately
  - CRUD flow is complete and works correctly

#### Webhooks (Area 12)
- **Bugs found:** 0
- **UX suggestions:** 0
- **All clear:**
  - Clean empty state with description and CTA
  - "Add webhook" form: Target Agent (required, shows Agent list with descriptions), Name (required), Description (optional)
  - Creation shows "Webhook created" dialog with URL and masked token, warning "Save this token now - it will not be shown again" (good security)
  - Webhook list shows: name, target Agent, trigger count, last triggered, enable/disable toggle
  - Actions: View logs, Copy URL, Regenerate token, Edit, Delete
  - Toggle works correctly with "Webhook updated" toast
  - View logs shows clean empty state ("No triggers yet")
  - Delete confirmation warns about external services receiving 404 errors (helpful)
  - Delete works correctly with "Webhook deleted" toast

#### Channels (Area 6 - partial)
- **All clear:**
  - Clean empty state with clear description
  - "Add channel" form: Name, Agent (required), Platform dropdown, platform-specific fields
  - Platform options: Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix
  - Telegram selected by default, shows Bot token field with password toggle and "How to get your bot token" link
  - Token stored encrypted in vault (noted in UI)

- **Note:** Both Contacts and Webhooks areas are very polished. CRUD flows work end-to-end, confirmation dialogs are present for destructive actions, toasts provide good feedback, empty states are clear. No bugs found in these areas.

### Next run
- Area 3: Conversations (send messages, chat UI, scroll behavior) - requires entering Agent page
- Area 13: MCP Servers (add, configure, remove) - testable from Settings
- Area 7: Memory (browse, search, delete) - testable from Settings

## 2026-03-04 16:40 UTC
### Area tested: MCP Servers (Area 13) + Plugins (Area 6b) + Settings sweep
- **Pages visited:** Settings > MCP Servers, Settings > Plugins, Settings > Vault, Settings > Memories, Settings > Files, Settings > Search, Settings > Users, Settings > Notifications
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target
- **Login:** Existing session

#### MCP Servers (Area 13)

  - Creation shows "MCP server added" toast, server appears immediately in list
  - Server card shows: name, status (Active), command, env var keys (values hidden)
  - Edit button opens "Edit MCP server" dialog with all fields pre-populated
  - Env var value correctly masked in edit form
  - Delete has proper confirmation dialog: "This will permanently remove this MCP server and disconnect it from all Agents"
  - Delete shows "MCP server deleted" toast, returns to empty state
  - Full CRUD cycle works end-to-end

#### Plugins (Area 6b) - BUG FOUND
- **Bugs found:** 1
  - **#43 (bug):** Clicking "Plugins" in Settings crashes the entire app with error boundary: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')". 100% reproducible. Critical - crashes entire React app.
- **UX suggestions:** 0

#### Settings sweep (other pages)
- **Vault:** Works. Filter tabs (All, Favorites, Secret, Credential, Card, Note, Identity), "Manage types" button, clean empty state
- **Memories:** Works. Model configuration (extraction + embedding models), re-embed button, search with category/Agent filters, 5 memories displayed with edit/delete buttons
- **Files:** Works. Clean empty state with upload CTA
- **Search:** Works. Shows existing Brave Search provider, default provider dropdown
- **Users:** Works. Shows user info (Nicolas VARROT), invitation section
- **Notifications:** Works. 8 notification types with toggles, external delivery section

### Next run
- Area 3: Conversations (send messages, chat UI, scroll behavior)
- Area 5: Provider settings (deeper testing of add/edit/delete/test connection)
- Area 14: Account (profile, password, language)

## 2026-03-04 20:40 UTC
### Area tested: Conversations (Area 3)
- **Pages visited:** / (home), /agent/dispatcher (Dispatcher conversation)
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target
- **Login:** Existing session (qa@hivekeep.local)

#### Findings

**Bug: Raw task prompt leaked as visible text (#46)**
- When a sub-task fails, the entire raw task prompt (including HTML source, internal instructions, tool call JSON) is rendered as plain text in the conversation
- Makes the conversation unreadable with walls of unformatted code
- Also a security concern (internal prompts exposed)

**Bug: Duplicate message content after Memorize tool calls (#47)**
- Last assistant message shows the same response content twice with minor wording differences
- Appears to be related to Memorize tool call results being rendered inline as message content

**Enhancement: Unlabeled buttons in conversation header (#48)**
- Multiple icon-only buttons in the nav bar and Agent header have no aria-label or tooltip
- Impossible to know their function without clicking them

**Bug: Model selector still shows non-chat models (#49)**
- Regression of #29 (closed) - model dropdown still lists TTS, transcribe, realtime, audio, image, codex, search-api models
- Users could accidentally select an incompatible model

**Other observations (not filed):**
- User avatar shows "??" for qa@hivekeep.local (likely because no display name is configured - works as designed)
- Model selector UI works well: provider grouping, search filter, nice layout
- Message actions (Copy, Edit & resend, React, Read aloud, Regenerate) are well placed
- Tool call panel on the right side works and shows timestamps
- "Compacting conversation" indicator with memory extraction count is clean
- Failed task cards with "Show error details" and "View task details" buttons are good
- Auto-scroll toggle and Scroll to top are present
- Formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, Code, Code block) present on input
- Send button correctly disabled when input is empty
- Date separators and time gap indicators ("48 min later") work nicely

**Note:** Browser repeatedly timed out when interacting with the Dispatcher conversation page. The page is very heavy due to long conversation history + large raw text blocks. Could be a performance concern for long conversations.

- **Bugs found:** 3 (issues #46, #47, #49)
- **UX suggestions:** 1 (issue #48)
- **All clear:** Model selector UI, message actions, tool call panel, compaction indicator, date separators, formatting toolbar, auto-scroll, empty state send button

### Next run
- Area 14: Account (profile, password, language settings)
- Area 3 continued: Test actually sending a message, editing a message, using reactions (was blocked by browser timeouts on Dispatcher page - try with Dev Agent which has less history)
- Area 15: Quick chat / Ephemeral sessions

## 2026-03-05 00:40 UTC
### Area tested: Account / My Account (Area 14)
- **Pages visited:** Home page, "My account" dialog (via avatar dropdown menu)
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target

#### Findings

**Bug: Profile data not persisted after saving (#54)**
- Fill in First name ("QA"), Last name ("Tester"), Pseudonym ("qa_bot")
- Click "Save changes" - success toast "Profile updated" appears
- Close and reopen dialog: all fields are empty
- Page reload: all fields still empty
- Avatar initials never update from "??" even after "successful" save
- Either the API call fails silently, backend doesn't persist, or dialog doesn't load saved data on mount

#### Other observations (not filed - working correctly)
- Avatar dropdown menu works: shows email, "My account", "Settings", "Sign out"
- "My account" dialog layout is clean: avatar upload button, email display, form fields, language dropdown
- Language dropdown works: shows English and Francais (only 2 languages, matching open issues #5/#6 for German/Spanish)
- Cancel and Close buttons work correctly
- Form validation: no required field validation on first/last name (acceptable - they're optional)
- File input for avatar is present (hidden, triggered by avatar button)
- Version button (v0.9.0) in sidebar timed out on click - could not verify what it opens

- **Bugs found:** 1 (issue #54)
- **UX suggestions:** 0
- **All clear:** Dialog layout, avatar dropdown menu, language selector, Cancel/Close behavior

### Next run
- Area 15: Quick chat / Ephemeral sessions
- Area 11: Contacts (add, approve, edit, delete)
- Area 12: Webhooks

## 2026-03-05 04:40 UTC
### Area tested: Contacts (Area 11), Webhooks (Area 12), MCP Servers (Area 13)
- **Pages visited:** Settings > Contacts, Settings > Webhooks, Settings > MCP Servers, Settings > Vault
- **Browser:** `openclaw` profile (headless Chromium), host target

#### Findings

**Enhancement: Submit buttons hidden until form is valid in create dialogs (#58)**
- In Add contact, Add webhook, and Add MCP server dialogs, the submit button is completely invisible until required fields are filled
- Better pattern: always show the button but keep it disabled
- Affects discoverability for new users

#### Other observations (not filed - working correctly)

**Contacts:**
- CRUD flow works perfectly: Add, Edit, Delete all function correctly
- Contact creation saves identifiers (email tested) properly
- Edit dialog loads saved data correctly (unlike profile - see #54)
- Delete has a proper confirmation dialog with clear warning text
- "Add note" feature works: shows Agent selector, scope (Global), and note text field
- Identifier type dropdown comprehensive: email, phone, mobile, twitter, instagram, linkedin, github, slack, website
- Type selector: Human/Agent options available
- "Link to system user" combobox present

**Webhooks:**
- Full CRUD works: create, view, delete
- Creation shows webhook URL and masked token with "Save this token now" warning (good security)
- Webhook list shows: toggle (enable/disable), View logs, Copy URL, Regenerate token, Edit, Delete
- Trigger log dialog shows (empty state with illustration)
- Delete confirmation dialog with clear "External services will receive 404 errors" warning
- Agent selector dropdown works in creation flow

**MCP Servers:**
- Empty state with clear description
- "What is this?" expandable info section
- Add dialog has: Name, Command, Arguments, Environment variables sections
- Add variable button for env vars

**Vault:**
- Categories: All, Favorites, Secret, Credential, Card, Note, Identity
- "Manage types" button present
- Clean empty state

**Performance note:**
- Conversation pages (/agent/dev, /agent/dispatcher) consistently cause browser snapshot timeouts (>20s)
- Settings dialog pages load and respond quickly
- This is a recurring issue noted in previous sessions

- **Bugs found:** 0
- **UX suggestions:** 1 (issue #58)
- **All clear:** Contacts CRUD, Webhooks CRUD, MCP Servers UI, Vault UI, delete confirmations, identifier management, webhook security (token masking), category filtering in Vault

### Next run
- Area 15: Quick chat / Ephemeral sessions (need to access via a conversation page, which may require addressing the conversation page timeout issue)
- Area 9: Settings page - remaining tabs (General, Plugins, Browse Plugins, Files, Channels, Users, Notifications)
- Area 8: Mini-apps

## 2026-03-05 08:40 UTC
### Area tested: Settings page - remaining tabs (Area 9)
- **Pages visited:** Settings > General, Search, Plugins, Browse Plugins, Memories, Files, Channels, Users, Notifications

#### Bugs found

**Bug: Plugins tab crashes app (regression of #43) - Issue #61**
- Settings > Plugins crashes entire app with error boundary
- Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- Requires page reload to recover
- 100% reproducible
- Was fixed in #43 but has regressed

**Bug: Browse Plugins shows error toasts - Issue #62**
- Settings > Browse Plugins shows two error toasts: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'plugins')`
- Page renders but shows "No plugins found"
- Related to #61, likely same underlying data/API issue

#### Other observations (not filed - working correctly)

**General tab:**
- Global prompt field works: typing enables Save button, token counter updates in real-time (~5 tokens for test text)
- "What is this?" expandable info section present
- Save button properly disabled when no changes

**Search tab:**
- Brave Search provider configured and displayed correctly
- Default provider dropdown with "Automatic (first valid)" option
- Provider card shows capabilities (Web Search)
- Delete, edit buttons present

**Memories tab:**
- Shows 5 memories with proper metadata (category, scope, Agent, source, relevance score)
- Search bar, category filter, Agent filter all present
- Model Configuration section: Extraction Model and Embedding Model dropdowns
- "Re-embed all memories" button available
- "Add memory" button at bottom
- Each memory has edit and delete buttons

**Files tab:**
- Clean empty state with illustration
- "Upload file" button (appears twice - one in empty state, one at bottom)

**Channels tab:**
- Clean empty state with good description
- "Add channel" button (appears twice - one in empty state, one at bottom)

- Clean layout

**Notifications tab:**
- Comprehensive toggle list: Notification sound, Input needed, User pending approval, Cron pending approval, MCP pending approval, Agent error, Agent alert, Mention
- All toggles checked by default
- External delivery section with "Add delivery channel" button
- Clean descriptions for each notification type

**Footer bar (all tabs):**
- Shows version (v0.9.0), uptime (1d 12h), and stats (2 Agents, 3 providers, 5 memories, 1 channel(?), 2 users(?))

- **Bugs found:** 2 (issues #61, #62)
- **UX suggestions:** 0
- **All clear:** General, Search, Memories, Files, Channels, Users, Notifications tabs all work well

### Next run
- Area 15: Quick chat / Ephemeral sessions
- Area 8: Mini-apps (gallery, viewer)
- Area 4: Tasks/Crons (create, edit, enable/disable, delete)

## 2026-03-05 12:40 UTC
### Area tested: Mini-Apps (Area 8)
- **Pages visited:** Home page sidebar (Mini-Apps section), App Gallery dialog

#### Bugs found

**Bug: Mini-Apps sidebar not updated after cloning from App Gallery - Issue #63**
- Clone an app via App Gallery, success toast appears, but sidebar still shows "No apps yet"
- Even after full page refresh, cloned app doesn't appear in sidebar
- Root cause: `useMiniApps` hook filters by `selectedAgentId`, which is null on home page
- The SSE event `miniapp:created` is filtered by agentId match, so it's silently dropped

#### UX suggestions

**Enhancement: Misleading empty state when no Agent selected - Issue #64**
- Sidebar shows "No apps yet - Ask an Agent to create one" even when apps exist on other Agents
- Should show "Select an Agent to see its apps" or show all apps across Agents

**Enhancement: Clone button doesn't update after cloning, allows duplicates - Issue #65**
- After cloning, the Clone button stays active (not "Owned"/"Cloned")
- User can clone the same app multiple times, creating duplicates
- Gallery doesn't refresh data or track cloned state

#### Other observations (code review, no issues filed)
- MiniAppViewer is well-built: postMessage SDK with toast, navigate, fullpage, confirm/prompt dialogs, clipboard, download, notifications, send-message, share, resize, locale/theme sync
- Rate limiting on send-message (5/30s) is good
- Sandbox iframe with appropriate permissions
- MiniAppCard has proper keyboard accessibility, delete confirmation
- E2E tests exist for gallery (16-mini-app-gallery.spec.ts)
- Could not test mini-app viewer/iframe rendering due to browser service timeouts

- **Bugs found:** 1 (issue #63)
- **UX suggestions:** 2 (issues #64, #65)
- **All clear:** MiniAppViewer component, MiniAppCard component, clone backend logic, E2E test coverage, SDK message handling

### Next run
- Area 15: Quick chat / Ephemeral sessions
- Area 4: Tasks/Crons (create, edit, enable/disable, delete)
- Area 3: Conversations (start, send messages, chat UI)

## 2026-03-05 16:40 UTC
### Area tested: Quick Chat / Ephemeral Sessions (Area 15)
- **Pages visited:** Code review of QuickChatPanel.tsx, useQuickChat.ts, useQuickSession.ts, quick-sessions.ts (routes), quick-session-cleanup.ts
- **Note:** Browser unavailable (sandbox disabled, no host tab), testing done via thorough code review

#### Bugs found

**Bug: Quick session memory saved without embedding - Issue #69**
- When closing with "Save as memory", route uses raw db.insert() instead of createMemory() service
- Memories have no embedding vector, won't appear in semantic search
- Critical: defeats the purpose of the "save as memory" feature

**Bug: Expired quick sessions closed silently without SSE notification - Issue #70**
- Cleanup service closes expired sessions in DB but doesn't emit SSE events
- Client panel stays open, user gets 409 errors when trying to send messages
- No visual feedback that the session expired

#### UX suggestions

**Enhancement: Model picker in quick chat changes Agent model globally - Issue #71**
- Changing model in quick chat affects main conversation too
- Should be session-scoped or removed from quick chat

**Enhancement: No quick session history/review - Issue #72**
- Closed sessions are inaccessible from UI despite being in DB for 7 days
- Users can't review past quick conversations

#### Other observations (no issues filed)
- SSE event handling is well-implemented with proper agentId+sessionId filtering
- Optimistic message updates work correctly
- Stop streaming functionality is properly wired
- File upload in quick chat reuses the main chat infrastructure (good)
- Sheet panel is 500px wide, responsive down to sm breakpoint
- Mobile: quick chat accessible via overflow menu (acceptable)
- Auto-scroll on new messages works
- Close dialog with save-as-memory checkbox is a nice touch
- Cleanup service handles both expiry and retention deletion correctly
- No E2E tests exist for quick chat

- **Bugs found:** 2 (issues #69, #70)
- **UX suggestions:** 2 (issues #71, #72)
- **All clear:** SSE streaming, message sending, file upload, stop streaming, session creation/closing flow, mobile menu access, auto-scroll, close dialog UX

### Next run
- Area 4: Tasks/Crons (create, edit, enable/disable, delete)
- Area 3: Conversations (start, send messages, chat UI)
- Area 11: Contacts

## 2026-03-06 08:40 UTC
### Area tested: Conversations (Area 3)
- **Pages visited:** Code review of ChatPanel.tsx, MessageBubble.tsx, MessageInput.tsx, ConversationHeader.tsx, ChatEmptyState.tsx, ConversationSearch.tsx, MarkdownContent.tsx, DateNavigator.tsx, DateSeparator.tsx, useChat.ts, useReactions.ts, useDraftMessage.ts, useInputHistory.ts, useExportConversation.ts, messages.ts (routes), reactions.ts (routes)
- **Note:** Browser unavailable (sandbox disabled, host browser timed out), testing done via thorough code review

#### Bugs found

**Bug: ReactionPicker popover does not close on outside click - Issue #78**
- Custom useState-based popover lacks click-outside handling
- User must click the trigger button again to dismiss
- Should use Radix Popover components already available in the app

**Bug: Inconsistent max-width between assistant message bubbles - Issue #79**
- Messages with tool calls: max-w-[80%]
- Messages without tool calls: max-w-[75%]
- Same Agent's messages have different widths depending on tool usage

**Bug: ConversationSearch Escape handler conflicts with modal Escape - Issue #80**
- Global window keydown listener fires even when modals are focused
- Pressing Escape closes both search bar AND any open modal simultaneously
- Should be scoped to the search input element

#### UX suggestions

**Enhancement: Search should include streaming message - Issue #81**
- Search passes `messages` (persisted only) to ConversationSearch
- Streaming message in `displayMessages` is not searchable

**Enhancement: Persist message drafts across page reloads - Issue #82**
- useDraftMessage uses module-level Map, lost on refresh
- Should use localStorage with debounced saves

**Enhancement: No server-side message length validation - Issue #83**
- Client shows character counter (cosmetic only)
- Server accepts arbitrarily long messages without limit
- Potential for abuse and unnecessary token consumption

#### Other observations (no issues filed)
- Chat system is well-architected: SSE streaming with batched token updates (50ms), optimistic message sends, infinite scroll with position restoration
- Keyboard shortcuts are comprehensive: Ctrl+F search, Escape refocus, Up/Down input history, Ctrl+1-9 agent switching
- Message grouping (2-min window) works well for visual clarity
- Date separators are sticky with backdrop blur, nice UX
- DateNavigator with jump-to-date is a solid feature
- ConversationStats and export (MD/JSON) are polished
- File drag-and-drop works at both panel level and input level
- Code blocks have copy, download, wrap toggle, line numbers, language detection
- Markdown rendering lazily loads heavy plugins (rehype-highlight, remark-math, rehype-katex)
- Mention autocomplete with @ trigger is well-implemented
- Formatting toolbar (bold, italic, code) with keyboard shortcuts
- Auto-scroll toggle with pin icon is clever
- Reading time estimate for long messages
- Context menu with copy, quote, edit/resend, read aloud, regenerate
- MarkdownContent plain text shortcut regex has a minor false positive (`\d+\.` matches version numbers like "1.0") but no visual impact
- No E2E tests found specifically for conversation search or reactions

- **Bugs found:** 3 (issues #78, #79, #80)
- **UX suggestions:** 3 (issues #81, #82, #83)
- **All clear:** SSE streaming, message sending/receiving, optimistic updates, file upload/drag-drop, input history, mention autocomplete, formatting toolbar, markdown rendering, code blocks, date separators, infinite scroll, export, context menu, typing indicator, empty state, auto-scroll, keyboard shortcuts, model picker, context usage display, clear conversation, regenerate

### Next run
- Area 11: Contacts (add, approve, edit, delete)
- Area 12: Webhooks (create, edit, test, delete)
- Area 13: MCP servers (add, configure, remove)

## 2026-03-06 12:40 UTC
### Area tested: Contacts (Area 11)

- **Note:** Browser unavailable (sandbox disabled, Chrome extension relay not attached), testing done via thorough code review

#### Bugs found: 3

1. **No Agent selector for "agent" type contacts** - Issue #84
   - ContactFormDialog shows user selector for "human" but no Agent selector for "agent" type
   - linkedAgentId always null from UI, breaking prompt builder resolution

2. **Server accepts whitespace-only and empty contact names** - Issue #85
   - POST checks `!name` (truthy for `"   "`), PATCH has no name validation at all
   - Client validates but server should not depend on it

3. **createContact silently returns existing on duplicate linkedUserId** - Issue #86
   - Returns existing contact with 201 status instead of 409 conflict
   - UI shows "Contact added" toast even though nothing was created

#### UX suggestions: 2

4. **Delete confirmation should warn about cascading effects** - Issue #87
   - Deleting contact cascades to platform IDs (channel access revocation)
   - Users not warned they're locking someone out of messaging

5. **N+1 API calls for platform IDs** - Issue #88
   - Each ContactCard fetches platform IDs separately
   - Should be included in contact detail response like identifiers/notes

#### All clear:
- Contact CRUD flow (create/edit/delete) works correctly via UI
- Identifier management (add/remove/edit with LabelCombo) is well-built
- Notes system with per-Agent scoping (global/private) is solid
- SSE real-time updates for contact changes
- Approval dialog for channel users (create new or link existing)
- FK cascade on delete properly configured for identifiers, notes, platform IDs
- Platform ID display with platform icons and hover-to-revoke UX
- Empty state with call to action
- Loading skeleton while fetching

- **Note:** Browser unavailable (sandbox disabled), testing done via thorough code review

- **Bugs found:** 3 (issues #89, #92, #94)
  - #89: Server accepts whitespace-only webhook names (no trim/validation)
  - #92: WebhookFormDialog swallows API errors silently (try/finally, no catch)
  - #94: Webhook creation does not validate agentId exists (FK error leaks to user)

- **UX suggestions:** 3 (issues #90, #91, #93)
  - #90: Webhook logs grow unbounded with no retention/cleanup
  - #91: Incoming webhook endpoint has no rate limiting
  - #93: Inactive webhooks should have visual distinction beyond toggle switch

- **All clear:**
  - Token generation and reveal flow is well-designed (shown once, hidden by default, copy buttons)
  - Constant-time token comparison (timingSafeEqual) for security
  - SSE real-time updates for webhook CRUD and triggers
  - Webhook log dialog with expandable payloads and source IP display

- **Note:** Browser unavailable (sandbox disabled, Chrome extension relay not attached), testing done via thorough code review

#### Bugs found: 3

1. **Server accepts whitespace-only MCP server names/commands** - Issue #95
   - POST uses `!body.name` (truthy for `"   "`), PATCH has zero validation
   - Same pattern as contacts (#85) and webhooks (#89)

2. **API exposes env var values (secrets) to frontend** - Issue #96
   - `serialize()` returns full env object including API keys and tokens
   - PasswordInput hides visually but values are in API response (DevTools)
   - Security concern

3. **Connection pool has no reconnection or cleanup** - Issue #98
   - Dead connections stay in pool, no timeout on connect, no shutdown hook
   - Tool calls silently fail if MCP process crashes

#### UX suggestions: 2

4. **No connection status indicator or health check** - Issue #97
   - "Active" badge = approval status, not connection health
   - No way to test if server works, no tool count, no error feedback

5. **Unicode chars silently dropped from tool names** - Issue #99
   - Non-Latin server names produce empty/colliding tool key prefixes

#### All clear:
- MCP server CRUD flow (create/edit/delete) works correctly
- E2E test coverage is comprehensive (create, edit, delete, empty state)
- Form validation on client side (name + command required)
- SSE real-time updates for server CRUD events
- ConfirmDeleteButton for safe deletion
- Approval workflow for Agent-created servers (pending_approval status)
- Auto-disconnect on config change (command/args/env)
- PATH augmentation for child processes (NVM detection)
- JSON Schema to Zod conversion is well-tested
- Tool access control per Agent (mcpAccess allowlist + auto-enabled for creator)
- Lazy connection pooling (connect on first use)
- Empty state with call to action
- Loading skeleton while fetching
- Help panel with documentation
- Env var key/value UI with PasswordInput for values
- Delete cascade removes agent_mcp_servers junction entries

- **UX suggestions:** 2 (issues created: #103, #104)
  - #103: Account dialog should support password change
  - #104: Account dialog should show last login and account creation date

- **All clear:**

  - #299: Contact note "add" silently overwrites existing note for same agent+scope (setContactNote upserts without UI warning)
  - #300: Contact identifier edits are non-atomic, sequential API calls can leave partial state on failure
  - #301: Platform ID creation returns misleading 409 DUPLICATE_PLATFORM_ID when contact doesn't exist (FK error caught generically)

- **UX suggestions:** 1 (issues created: #302)
  - #302: Contact search should include platform IDs and notes (currently only searches name + identifiers)

#### All clear:
- ContactsSettings: proper loading skeleton, empty state with action, search bar appears when contacts exist, SSE real-time updates for create/update/delete
- ContactCard: clean layout with icon (User/Bot), type badge, linked user badge, identifiers as badges, edit/delete with confirmation, cascade warning on delete mentioning platform IDs
- ContactFormDialog: proper form reset on open/close, name validation (required, max 200), type selector (human/agent), conditional linked user/agent selectors, identifier CRUD with combobox label picker (suggestions + custom), proper error display
- ContactNotes: per-agent notes with avatar, scope icons (global/private), inline edit with textarea, add note flow with agent selector + scope selector, proper empty states
- ContactPlatformIds: platform selector with extra platforms (IRC, webchat), inline add form with Enter/Escape support, revoke with confirmation dialog explaining consequences
- Server routes: solid input validation (name trim, max lengths, type enum check, required fields), proper 404/409 error codes, user-link uniqueness check
- Server services: batch-fetched listContactsWithDetails (efficient), search across names/identifiers/notes, FK cascade on delete, SSE broadcasts on all mutations, duplicate identifier prevention
