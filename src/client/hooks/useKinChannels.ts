 * Lightweight projection of /api/channels grouped by Kin, for the sidebar
 * binding badges. Refreshes live on the channel:created/updated/deleted
 * and the channel:transferred SSE events broadcast by the service so badges
 * migrate between Kins in real time, regardless of whether the transfer
 * was initiated by the tool, the REST endpoint, or another tab.
 *
 * Pulls only what the badge row needs (id, name, platform, status) to keep
 * the consuming KinCard prop surface narrow. Inactive channels are dropped
 * client-side: the sidebar is meant to surface "what the Kin is currently
 * reachable on", and an inactive channel does not deliver messages.
